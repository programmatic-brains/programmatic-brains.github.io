            <p>
                The content creators, Ganeshan Nainar and Aniruddh Singh are two 12 th passouts and both were very much inclined towards coding since 11th. During our higher classes we observed that most of the people were not able to understand coding and were simply mugging up the codes without actually understanding it. We believe that understanding is the key and we henceforth started this journey of sharing our knowledge and make people understand the language and make it their best friends. We understand the sentiments of students as we were also the same students once, and thus we think we are very much correct to guide our juniors. Our experience of boards and knowledge of the exam patterns will help our juniors to not only understand coding but also score well in exam as we also give some tips during our lesson which might give you an edge over others. Talking about HSC scores we both have secured above 95 up in each subject of CS, with Aniruddh having 199 and Ganeshan having a score of 189 in subjects of CS .. So we feel, that we could be the right people to guide you and benefit you with our knowledge...
